README

Yeah this is based on the GPRO api - found here https://api.gpro.net.

Will be incrementally updated to use all calls from here, and hten create a tool that will allow you to generate setups/run practice.

To use this yourself - create the API token as explained on above website (through GPRO app), then after downloading create a .env file, and paste the token in there in the form 'token' = "{token}". This will allow it to be used by you, and will then work as expected (theoretically!)
